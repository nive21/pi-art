# Data Visualization of Mathematical Constants

This project visualizes the decimal digits of famous mathematical constants like Pi, Euler's number (e), and the Golden Ratio.

### How It Works

- Every 6 digits of the decimal expansion are mapped to 3 digits for the x-coordinate and 3 digits for the y-coordinate.
- A line is plotted to the next point every few milliseconds using D3.js.
